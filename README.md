## Project codename: knowhere
A single page web-app for Singapore MRT Routing (only for future MRT routes)
* Created using Create React App
* Please note that the layout is optimized for mobile ratio, and not yet optimized for desktop
* Route sorted by the most convenient first (less interchange) rather than least stop
* Live demo at https://carloswirama.github.io/knowhere/

Tech-stack:
- React

<br>

Supporting libraries:
- styled-components
- Material-ui
- Jest

<br>

I'm not using Redux (yet) because this app is still small and can be handled by built-in React state manager. I implemented Dijkstra algorithm from scratch (instead of using library from somewhere else) to get a better understanding about how Dijkstra works. I only got to write unit test for routing algorithm, will add some more later.

TODO:
- fix bug when routing Choa Chu Kang -> Marine Terrace (duplicate route)
- Add recent search
- Welcome Page

## =============== README from Create React App ===============

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
